## üé® Visual Style & Design

The platform's design is modern, minimalist, and illustrative, creating a memorable user experience.

- **Hero Section:** The post-login dashboard is a full-screen, interactive hero section with a dynamic parallax effect that responds to the user's mouse movement.
- **Color Palette:** The primary design uses a clean, monochromatic palette (`#F0F0F0` light grey, black, and white) to emphasize the illustrative assets. Purple is used as a subtle accent for key actions.
- **Typography:**
    - **Headlines:** Uses **Anton** (`font-display`), a bold, impactful display font for a strong visual hierarchy.
    - **Body & UI:** Uses **Inter** (`font-sans`), a clean and highly readable sans-serif for all other text.
- **Illustrations:** The hero section is populated with hand-drawn style illustrations and animated GIFs themed around college, learning, and innovation.
- **3D Text Effect:** Headlines feature a prominent 3D shadow effect, achieved with a custom Tailwind CSS plugin.
- **UI:** The navigation bar is designed to be "smart," appearing transparent over the hero section and solid on other pages for a seamless look.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example: 3D Text Effect

The signature 3D text effect is enabled by a custom plugin in `tailwind.config.ts`.

```typescript
// tailwind.config.ts

import plugin from 'tailwindcss/plugin'

export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        display: ['Anton', 'sans-serif'],
      },
      textShadow: {
        'default': '0.1em 0.1em 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    plugin(function ({ matchUtilities, theme }) {
      matchUtilities(
        { 'text-shadow': (value) => ({ textShadow: value }) },
        { values: theme('textShadow') }
      )
    }),
  ],
